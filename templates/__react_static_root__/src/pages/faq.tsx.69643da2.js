The cost includes laying track, installing catenary, constructing three station stops, supplementing the current Green Line fleet with two new streetcars, design, soft costs, and contingencies.

These include Pondside abutting the length of South Huntington Avenue, the Boylston Street neighborhood, and the Centre Street neighborhood surrounding the Mary Curley School. Most importantly, it will serve the Hyde Square neighborhood, which has been designated Boston’s “Latin Quarter“ by the Boston City Council and the Massachusetts Cultural Council.

It will put Hyde Square on the MBTA system map as a destination. Later this year, when the Somerville extension opens for service, the MBTA plans to run the E-line from Medford/Tufts through downtown Boston to the current Heath Street terminus.
