<FAQ
 question="Why extend the Green Line to Hyde Square?"
 answer="Extension of the line to Hyde Square will connect Hyde Square and adjacent neighborhoods
         directly to the central subway. It will provide no-transfer public transit to and from Park Street
         Station and Government Center for the increasing number of residents on South Huntington
         Avenue and in adjoining neighborhoods. The extension will also provide a more reliable,
         comfortable ride than the Route 39 bus, and relieve excessive rush hour crowding on the 39."/>
<FAQ
    question="How long is the extension and what is the route?"
    answer="The extension from the current last stop at Heath Street/VA to the Hyde Square neighborhood is
            approximately 0.65 miles. The streetcar will travel along South Huntington Avenue to Hyde
            Square/Canary Square with a likely intermediate stop at Bynner/Perkins streets."/>

<FAQ
    question="Will the extension follow “complete streets” guidelines?">
    Yes. We envision a segregated cycle lane on each side of South Huntington Avenue built between the
    sidewalk and the parking lane; intersection bump-outs, signage, and benches for pedestrians; and where
    traffic signals exist, pedestrian and cyclist signal sequences. We also propose sheltered accessible transit
    stops with fare vending machines and passenger amenities. More information about “complete streets”
    can be found [here](https://smartgrowthamerica.org/program/national-complete-streets-coalition/what-are-complete-streets/).

<FAQ
    question="What suggestions have been offered for a Hyde Square terminus?"
    answer="There are several possible options for a terminus. The South Huntington Avenue option at the intersection
            of Moraine and Centre streets is the simplest and likely least expensive. It would have a boarding
            platform in the middle of the avenue with tracks on either side of the platform."/>

<FAQ
    question="What public officials support the extension?">
    They include State Representative Nika Elugardo, State Senator Sonia Chang Diaz, and District City Councilor Kendra Hicks. The extension is
    also supported by the City of Boston Transportation Department; it is included in the [City’s Go Boston
    2030 Plan](https://www.boston.gov/sites/default/files/file/document_files/2017/03/go_boston_2030_-_7_projects_and_policies_spreads_1.pdf).

<FAQ
  question="What Jamaica Plain organizations and institutions support the extension?"
  answer="The extension is supported by the following: The Jamaica Plain Neighborhood Council, The Hyde Square
          Task Force, The Jamaica Pond Association, Sherrill House, Mount Pleasant Home, AstraZeneca Hope
          Lodge, Eden Properties (the Brynx development), and a coalition of Hyde Square merchants."/>

<FAQ
  question="How much will the extension cost?"
  answer="Based on an informal cost analysis of other new streetcar projects in the United States (including Omaha,
          St. Louis, Pittsburgh, San Francisco, and Washington DC), the overall cost estimate for the 0.65 mile
          extension from Heath/VA to Hyde Square ranges roughly between $50 and $60 million in 2021 dollars.
          The cost includes laying track, installing catenary, constructing three station stops, supplementing the
          current Green Line fleet with two new streetcars, design, soft costs, and contingencies. In addition,
          designing and building the “complete streets” component of the project would likely cost about $2.5
          million."/>

<FAQ
  question="What neighborhoods will benefit from the extension and how will they benefit?"
  answer="The extension will benefit residents in the northernmost neighborhoods of Jamaica Plain. These include
          Pondside abutting the length of South Huntington Avenue, the Boylston Street neighborhood, and the
          Centre Street neighborhood surrounding the Mary Curley School. Most importantly, it will serve the
          Hyde Square neighborhood, which has been designated Boston’s “Latin Quarter“ by the Boston City
          Council and the Massachusetts Cultural Council. The extension will provide a direct single-seat ride
          connecting Hyde Square to the central subway, promoting the square as a destination for many throughout
          the metropolitan area with its unique shopping and dining experiences."/>

<FAQ
  question="How will the new E-line Hyde Square extension be integrated with the rest of the Green Line system,
            and will there be a connection to the new Green Line extension into Somerville?"
  answer="The Green Line extension from the current Heath Street terminus to Hyde Square will become an integral
          part of the overall Green Line system. It will put Hyde Square on the MBTA system map as a destination.
          Later this year, when the Somerville extension opens for service, the MBTA plans to run the E-line from
          Medford/Tufts through downtown Boston to the current Heath Street terminus. So it is expected that once
          the Hyde Square extension is completed, service from Somerville will continue on to Hyde Square."/>

<FAQ
  question="What will fares cost on the new extension?"
  answer="Fares on the Green Line extension to Hyde Square will be consistent with the fares that are currently
          collected on the Green Line and the subway system generally."/>
