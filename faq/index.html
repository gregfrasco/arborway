It will provide no-transfer public transit to and from Park Street Station and Government Center for the increasing number of residents on South Huntington Avenue and in adjoining neighborhoods. The extension will also provide a more reliable, comfortable ride than the Route 39 bus, and relieve excessive rush hour crowding on the 39.</p></div></div><div class="MuiPaper-root MuiCard-root MuiPaper-elevation1 MuiPaper-rounded" style="margin-bottom:25px"><div class="MuiCardContent-root"><h5 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h5 MuiTypography-colorPrimary" style="font-weight:bold;margin-bottom:5px">How long is the extension and what is the route?</h5><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1">The extension from the current last stop at Heath Street/VA to the Hyde Square neighborhood is approximately 0.65 miles. The streetcar will travel along South Huntington Avenue to Hyde Square/Canary Square with a likely intermediate stop at Bynner/Perkins streets.</p></div></div><div class="MuiPaper-root MuiCard-root MuiPaper-elevation1 MuiPaper-rounded" style="margin-bottom:25px"><div class="MuiCardContent-root"><h5 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h5 MuiTypography-colorPrimary" style="font-weight:bold;margin-bottom:5px">Will the extension follow “complete streets” guidelines?</h5><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1" style="padding-top:6px;padding-bottom:6px">Yes. We envision a segregated cycle lane on each side of South Huntington Avenue built between the
sidewalk and the parking lane; intersection bump-outs, signage, and benches for pedestrians; and where
traffic signals exist, pedestrian and cyclist signal sequences. We also propose sheltered accessible transit
stops with fare vending machines and passenger amenities. More information about “complete streets”
can be found <a href="https://smartgrowthamerica.org/program/national-complete-streets-coalition/what-are-complete-streets/">here</a>.</p></div></div><div class="MuiPaper-root MuiCard-root MuiPaper-elevation1 MuiPaper-rounded" style="margin-bottom:25px"><div class="MuiCardContent-root"><h5 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h5 MuiTypography-colorPrimary" style="font-weight:bold;margin-bottom:5px">What suggestions have been offered for a Hyde Square terminus?</h5><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1">There are several possible options for a terminus. The South Huntington Avenue option at the intersection of Moraine and Centre streets is the simplest and likely least expensive. It would have a boarding platform in the middle of the avenue with tracks on either side of the platform.</p></div></div><div class="MuiPaper-root MuiCard-root MuiPaper-elevation1 MuiPaper-rounded" style="margin-bottom:25px"><div class="MuiCardContent-root"><h5 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h5 MuiTypography-colorPrimary" style="font-weight:bold;margin-bottom:5px">What public officials support the extension?</h5><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1" style="padding-top:6px;padding-bottom:6px">They include State Representative Nika Elugardo, State Senator Sonia Chang Diaz, and District City Councilor Kendra Hicks. The extension is
also supported by the City of Boston Transportation Department; it is included in the <a href="https://www.boston.gov/sites/default/files/file/document_files/2017/03/go_boston_2030_-_7_projects_and_policies_spreads_1.pdf">City’s Go Boston

The cost includes laying track, installing catenary, constructing three station stops, supplementing the current Green Line fleet with two new streetcars, design, soft costs, and contingencies. In addition, designing and building the “complete streets” component of the project would likely cost about $2.5 million.</p></div></div><div class="MuiPaper-root MuiCard-root MuiPaper-elevation1 MuiPaper-rounded" style="margin-bottom:25px"><div class="MuiCardContent-root"><h5 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h5 MuiTypography-colorPrimary" style="font-weight:bold;margin-bottom:5px">What neighborhoods will benefit from the extension and how will they benefit?</h5><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1">The extension will benefit residents in the northernmost neighborhoods of Jamaica Plain. These include Pondside abutting the length of South Huntington Avenue, the Boylston Street neighborhood, and the Centre Street neighborhood surrounding the Mary Curley School. Most importantly, it will serve the Hyde Square neighborhood, which has been designated Boston’s “Latin Quarter“ by the Boston City Council and the Massachusetts Cultural Council. The extension will provide a direct single-seat ride connecting Hyde Square to the central subway, promoting the square as a destination for many throughout the metropolitan area with its unique shopping and dining experiences.</p></div></div><div class="MuiPaper-root MuiCard-root MuiPaper-elevation1 MuiPaper-rounded" style="margin-bottom:25px"><div class="MuiCardContent-root"><h5 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h5 MuiTypography-colorPrimary" style="font-weight:bold;margin-bottom:5px">How will the new E-line Hyde Square extension be integrated with the rest of the Green Line system, and will there be a connection to the new Green Line extension into Somerville?</h5><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1">The Green Line extension from the current Heath Street terminus to Hyde Square will become an integral part of the overall Green Line system. It will put Hyde Square on the MBTA system map as a destination. Later this year, when the Somerville extension opens for service, the MBTA plans to run the E-line from Medford/Tufts through downtown Boston to the current Heath Street terminus. So it is expected that once the Hyde Square extension is completed, service from Somerville will continue on to Hyde Square.</p></div></div><div class="MuiPaper-root MuiCard-root MuiPaper-elevation1 MuiPaper-rounded" style="margin-bottom:25px"><div class="MuiCardContent-root"><h5 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h5 MuiTypography-colorPrimary" style="font-weight:bold;margin-bottom:5px">What will fares cost on the new extension?</h5><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1">Fares on the Green Line extension to Hyde Square will be consistent with the fares that are currently collected on the Green Line and the subway system generally.</p></div></div></div></div><footer class="MuiContainer-root jss10 MuiContainer-maxWidthLg"><div class="MuiGrid-root MuiGrid-container"><div class="MuiGrid-root MuiGrid-item MuiGrid-grid-xs-6 MuiGrid-grid-sm-4"><h6 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h6 MuiTypography-colorTextPrimary MuiTypography-gutterBottom">Initiatives</h6><ul><li><a class="MuiTypography-root MuiLink-root MuiLink-underlineHover MuiTypography-subtitle1 MuiTypography-colorTextSecondary" href="https://thankful-mud-0e0d6760f.azurestaticapps.net/hydesquare">Hyde Square</a></li><li><a class="MuiTypography-root MuiLink-root MuiLink-underlineHover MuiTypography-subtitle1 MuiTypography-colorTextSecondary" href="https://thankful-mud-0e0d6760f.azurestaticapps.net/otherprojects">Other projects</a></li></ul></div><div class="MuiGrid-root MuiGrid-item MuiGrid-grid-xs-6 MuiGrid-grid-sm-4"><h6 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h6 MuiTypography-colorTextPrimary MuiTypography-gutterBottom">Useful Links</h6><ul><li><a class="MuiTypography-root MuiLink-root MuiLink-underlineHover MuiTypography-subtitle1 MuiTypography-colorTextSecondary" href="https://thankful-mud-0e0d6760f.azurestaticapps.net/about">About Us</a></li><li><a aria-current="page" class="MuiTypography-root MuiLink-root MuiLink-underlineHover MuiTypography-subtitle1 MuiTypography-colorTextSecondary" href="https://thankful-mud-0e0d6760f.azurestaticapps.net/faq">FAQ</a></li><li><a class="MuiTypography-root MuiLink-root MuiLink-underlineHover MuiTypography-subtitle1 MuiTypography-colorTextSecondary" href="https://thankful-mud-0e0d6760f.azurestaticapps.net/archive">Archive</a></li></ul></div><div class="MuiGrid-root MuiGrid-item MuiGrid-grid-xs-6 MuiGrid-grid-sm-4"><h6 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h6 MuiTypography-colorTextPrimary MuiTypography-gutterBottom">Contact</h6><ul><li><a class="MuiTypography-root MuiLink-root MuiLink-underlineHover MuiTypography-subtitle1 MuiTypography-colorTextSecondary" href="https://thankful-mud-0e0d6760f.azurestaticapps.net/contact-us">Contact Us</a></li><li><a class="MuiTypography-root MuiLink-root MuiLink-underlineHover MuiTypography-subtitle1 MuiTypography-colorTextSecondary" href="https://thankful-mud-0e0d6760f.azurestaticapps.net/support">Support</a></li><li><a class="MuiTypography-root MuiLink-root MuiLink-underlineHover MuiTypography-subtitle1 MuiTypography-colorTextSecondary" href="https://thankful-mud-0e0d6760f.azurestaticapps.net/donate">Donate</a></li></ul></div></div><hr class="MuiDivider-root" style="margin-top:1rem"/><div class="MuiBox-root jss18"><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-root MuiLink-root MuiLink-underlineHover MuiTypography-colorPrimary MuiTypography-alignCenter MuiTypography-body1" href="https://thankful-mud-0e0d6760f.azurestaticapps.net/" style="font-weight:bold">The Arborway Committee for Public Transit, Inc.</p><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body2 MuiTypography-colorTextSecondary MuiTypography-alignCenter">A 501(c)(3) Organization</p><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-root MuiLink-root MuiLink-underlineHover MuiTypography-body2 MuiTypography-colorPrimary MuiTypography-alignCenter MuiTypography-body1" href="mailto:arborway.committee@gmail.com">Arborway.Committee@gmail.com</p><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body2 MuiTypography-colorTextSecondary MuiTypography-alignCenter">c/o 51R Eliot Street Jamaica Plain 02130</p><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body2 MuiTypography-colorTextSecondary MuiTypography-alignCenter">Copyright © <!-- -->2022<!-- -->.</p></div></footer></div></div><script type="text/javascript">window.__routeInfo = JSON.parse("{\"template\":\"__react_static_root__/src/pages/faq.tsx\",\"sharedHashesByProp\":{},\"data\":{},\"path\":\"faq\",\"sharedData\":{},\"siteData\":{}}");</script><script defer="" type="text/javascript" src="https://thankful-mud-0e0d6760f.azurestaticapps.net/templates/styles.2a7f1e6d.js"></script><script defer="" type="text/javascript" src="https://thankful-mud-0e0d6760f.azurestaticapps.net/templates/vendors~main.e85f58b3.js"></script><script defer="" type="text/javascript" src="https://thankful-mud-0e0d6760f.azurestaticapps.net/main.9e910a88.js"></script></body></html>
